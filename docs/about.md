# About

The Materia Directory is for anyone looking to make new friends, join communities, find new streamers to watch and a place to see all of Materia's most commited raiders. I've compiled a list of every streamer I could find that spends most of their time on Materia

## Streamer List Rules

The only rules for those that were added to the list are that you play primarily on Materia when you do stream FFXIV and have streamed FFXIV at some point in the last 6 months. Streamers are labelled with tags appropriate to the type of content they stream, whether that be MSQ for the first time or doing end game content. As those are the only rules, this list is based entirely upon that. As this is unbiased and their history is largely unknown, any personal grudges or past altercations will be disregarded in any streamers addition to the list.

For anyone that was added to this list and wants to be removed for whatever reason, please feel free to reach out to me at materiadirectory@gmail.com and I can have you removed from the list no questions asked. 

Similarly as well if there any tags you feel apply that I've missed or you want to see added please let me know. If there is anyone that you know of that meets the criteria stated that I may have missed or not known of, please fill in the Google Form below and they'll be added after verification. For any new additions to the list they'll have to meet the requirement of streaming primarily on Materia when playing FFXIV and have to have streamed for at least 8 hours over a 30 day period.
